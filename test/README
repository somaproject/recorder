This is a simple benchmark that creates believable spike data and
attempts to write it to disk, with varying chunk sizes and block
sizes. 

There is infrastructure in place to enable multiple threads using the thread-save version of the hdf5 library, but evidently all the real work is serialized, so this makes no performance difference. 

The resulting files are: 
benchmark.dat: running it on the athlon x2 to disk
benchmark.tmpfs.dat: running it on the athlon x2 to tmpfs
benchmark.tmpfs.2threads.dat: running it on the athlon x2 to tmpfs, with multiple write threads

the best-case performance, when writing to ram, is ~20 MB/sec, suggesting that we're in no way limited by disk speed. 

To create tempfs volumes
sudo mount tmpfs /mnt/tmpfs -t tmpfs

./configure --enable-threadsafe --enable-cxx --prefix=/usr/local --with-pthread=/usr
