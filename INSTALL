Requirements
=================================
To install you will need: 

dbus-c++
-----------
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus-c%2B%2B

git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-c++/

However, the existing freedesktop version has issues, so you'll want 
the Soma fork: 

http://github.com/somaproject/dbus-c--/tree/master
Remember to configure with --enable-glib



log4cpp
------------
now included with ubuntu!

aptitude install liblog4cpp5-dev

hdf5
------------
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/


Building 
==================================
The build system uses CMake. To build, do the following: 

cmake /path/to/build/location   (this can be just .) 

make
sudo make install

Testing
=================================
To run the unit tests, type

make test

Note that the unit tests require that you have PyTables, the python
HDF5 library, installed.
