Requirements
=================================
To install you will need: 

dbus-c++
-----------

dbus-c++ are c++ bindings for DBus. See
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus-c%2B%2B

However, the existing freedesktop version has issues, so you'll want 
the Soma fork: 

http://github.com/somaproject/dbus-c--/tree/master

Remember to configure with --enable-glib

log4cpp
------------
now included with ubuntu!
aptitude install liblog4cpp5-dev

hdf5 1.8.x 
------------
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/ . HDF5 1.8 provides enough improvements
that upgrading is worth it. Sadly, for many this will require building
from source. 

Building 
==================================
The build system uses CMake. To build, do the following: 

cmake /path/to/build/location   (this can be just .) 

make
sudo make install

Testing
=================================
To run the unit tests, type

make test

Note that the unit tests require that you have PyTables, the python
HDF5 library, installed.
