Soma Recorder 
===========================

The Soma Recorder is a DBus-enabled server which saves soma network
data to disk in HDF5 format. The recorder consists of two programs: 

soma-recorder-manager : the primary server
soma-recorder-experiment : the per-experiment server

For build instructions see INSTALL.

Tests
-----------------------
There are two sets of tests, both can be run
by "make test". 

   Regular tests: any compiled binary under tests/

   DBus server tests: Python-wrapped subprocess-based dbus tests, 
   under tests/dbus. Requires the Nose testing framework, a local 
   dbus daemon, and a prayer.
