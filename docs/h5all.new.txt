Generic idea for our on-disk objects:: 


Pretty much everything has static (named) "open" and "create" constructors. 

Our design discipline is "an object is not 'complete' until it fully 
reflects the state of the on-disk object" and thus we cannot call member
functions until things are up-and-atom. 

The "open" methods will be appropritately recursive. 

The open methods can manipulate internal object state -- remember, the
object is not yet "complete", it is in the process of being constructed!
