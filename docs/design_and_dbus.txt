The recorder daemon controls all saving of data to the soma system. It
will run under dedicated hardware and attempt best-possible packet
delivery. 

Generally a single experiment will be represented by a single
file. Each experiment is divided up into a number of temporal
epochs. These represent the top-level objects in the HDF5 file.


The dbus interface to the recorder object has the following methods: 

createFile("filename") : creates the requested file
closeFile() : closes the current file
createEpoch("epochname")
switchEpoch("epochname")
enableDataRX(type, src)
disableDataRX(type, src)
startRecording()
endRecording()
