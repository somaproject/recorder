manager-introspect.xml contains the DBUS introspection information
for the recorder experiment manager

The Soma Recording manager exists at the well-known name "soma.recording.Manager"
and exposes two interfaces: 

   "soma.recording.Manager" : the application-facing interface for controlling the
   creation and parsing of experiments

   "soma.recording.ExperimentRegistry" : The interface that the separate
   expeirment process uses to register / unregister. Not used by
   end-user applications. 

Interface: soma.recording.Manager
----------------------------------
  Experiments are effectively "hdf5 files" that are on the disk. 

  They can be "open", that is, they have an associated server running
  and accessable from dbus. 

  ListAvailableExperiments: Returns a list of Experiment Names that
  can be opened. 

  ListOpenExperiments: returns a list of Experiment dbus connections
  (not names) that can be connected to and queried
  
  OpenExperiment : request that a particular experiment name be opened. 
  
  CreateExperiment : create a particular experiment with the requested
  name. Will fail if the experiment already exists or the name is somehow	
  invalid. 

  GetStatistics: Returns a dicationary of string->string indicating
    various useful recorder parameters, like time, available disk
    space, soma IP, etc. 

  signals: 
    ExperimentAvailable
    StatsUpdate

Interface: soma.recording.ExperimentRegistry
---------------------------------------------
This is the interface that soma-recording-expeirment uses to
register and unregister experiments. Experiments register
by invoking "Register" with their -name-, and the associated
connection information is deduced by dbus.
