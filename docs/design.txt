The recorder takes in packets and events from the data stream and
saves them to disk as HDF5 files.

This means that it understands the internal meaning of the data
packets, and additionally save all outbound event packets.


Record runs and connects to the master dbus daemon, exposing and
reflecting the following methods:

openFile(filename)
createEpoch()
switchEpoch()
closeFile()

createEpoch() just creates the epoch

Questions: 

There's clearly the notion of the "current epoch", with associated data

createEpoch(string name):
   creates an epoch with name Name off the root tree
switchEpoch():
   changes the current epoch; by default reopens all groups that are marked as enabled


enableRx(typ, src)
disableRx(typ, src)
switchEpoch(name)
startRecord()
stopRecord()

The recorder contains a network object, and processes data; it takes a
network object


recorder(network, filename)

what if we have one recorder associated with each file? That's not a bad decision
