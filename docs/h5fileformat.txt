All data is saved by the recorder currently using the HDF5 file
format. 

A "file" is meant to represent a single recording session for a single
animal.  Data is saved in recording periods called epochs. Within each
epoch, data is organized by type, and then by name. 

/epochName/
   /tspikes
   /waves
   /events
   /notes
   /(other multimodal data)

---------------
tspikes (and waves)
---------------

Each entry in tspikes is a table consisting of tspike data, named
according to a 'human-readable' name.

for example, under tspikes:
/hipp1
 hipp2
 ec4
 pfc1

There are attributes that help with data management here. 

The right answer would seem to be store data by source and only "tag"
it with meaningful names, since we only record each source to one
destination.
